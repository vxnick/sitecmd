Sitecmd (pronounced _site-command_) is a PHP-based website framework designed to allow you to quickly and easily implement a dynamic website.

Sitecmd was created because I found it tedious to create rewrite rules, route handling code and other associated scaffolding whenever developing a website. Now I can unzip or branch sitecmd in the target directory, change a few configuration values and add in my content, and job done.

Sitecmd is also ideal for use as an application framework, as it incorporates the hugely useful [Flourish](http://flourishlib.com/) Library as well as hook points (named events) and non-intrusive templating.
